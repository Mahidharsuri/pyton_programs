# iterate a each character of a string
# start: 0 to start with first character
# stop: size-1 because index starts with 0

output:
Enter word mahidhar

Printing only even index chars
index[ 0 ] m
index[ 2 ] h
index[ 4 ] d
index[ 6 ] a


#By using slicing


name= 'mahidhar'

output:
length of characters:  8
even index: m
even index: h
even index: d
even index: a
